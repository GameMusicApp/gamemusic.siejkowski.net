<h1>Privacy policy for Video Game Music app</h1>
<h2>Data collection by the Video Game Music app</h2>
<p>The Video Game Music app doesn't collect any data on any server nor any where outside your device and your iCloud account. I cannot access, check or process the data in any way.</p>
<h3>What data is collected</h3>
<p>
The app collects the identifiers of the items (albums, artists) that the user has marked as favourites.
</p>
<h3>How data is collected</h3>
<p>The identifiers are stored in a database on the device and synced between devices using the iCloud account via the CloudKit technology. They are never sent nor stored outside the device.</p>
<h3>How data is used</h3>
<p>The identifiers are used to provide the feature of choosing the favourites to the user and to provide the recommendations based on those favourites. The recomendation algorithm is completely local and on device.</p>
<h2>Data collection by the Third Party services</h2>
<p>Video Game Music uses Spotify SDK and Apple MusicKit and StoreKit frameworks to allow the user to connect the streaming services accounts and start the playback from the app.</p>
<p>The streaming services are collecting the data about the user listening: when and what music is being started, stoped, paused, skiped.</p>

<h3>How to stop data gathering and how to delete the data</h3>
